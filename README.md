# Fullstack Collection App

I developed this app as part of a course project to showcase my skills in building a full stack app from scratch. The app allows users to browse their game library, edit game information, add new games, and delete existing ones. While the app is not yet deployed, I plan to continue refining it and adding user authentication features in the future. You can check out the app's GitHub repository via the link provided.

The tech stack used includes TypeScript, React, Redux, SQLite, Express.js, Node.js
